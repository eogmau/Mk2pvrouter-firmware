# Mk2 PV Router Arduino Firmware

## Original_Mk2PvRouter
A set of original Arduino firmaware for Mk2 PV Router created by Robin Emley

## Mk2_noDisplay_4_ISR_Drivenv12
A significantly enhanced and modernized version of the classic Mk2 PV Router code, originally developed by Robin Emley.   
While the core principle of diverting surplus solar PV energy to a resistive load (like a hot water heater) remains, this version introduces a more robust, configurable, and connectable architecture suitable for modern smart home integration.  
* The code has been significantly refactored, modernized, and improved with the assistance of **Google's Gemini 2.5 Pro**.
